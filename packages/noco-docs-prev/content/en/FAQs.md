## What is available in free version ?
- NocoDB has just one version that is free & open source.
- In it you will notice advanced features are all available for free.
    - ACL
    - Collaboration
    - Advanced views : Form View, Gallery view, Kanban (coming soon)
    - Share view, 
    - Embed view 
    - Password protected view,
    - Automations
    - API token support.    
- And we would never move these features from free to an enterprise version of NocoDB.
- There is no limitations to number of projects, rows or columns either.

 
## Do you plan to have enterprise edition ?
For features that make sense for enterprises like below - yes 
- SSO, SLA, Organisation wide reports and analytics, 
- Advanced Audit or ACL,  
- Bespoke implementations & integrations,
- A hosted solution.
   
And increasing number of our customers are requesting it.  

## How do we decide if a feature is enterprise or not ?
- Depends on the effort and whether the intended users are enterprises.
