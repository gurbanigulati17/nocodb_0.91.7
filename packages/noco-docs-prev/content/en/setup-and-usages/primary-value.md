## What is a 'Primary value' ?
- Primary value as the name stands is the primary or main value within a row of a table that you generally associate that row with.
- It should be usually associated with a column which is uniquely identifiable. However, this uniqueness is not enforced at the database level.

## What is the use of 'Primary value' ?
- Within a spreadsheet, primary value are always highlighted so that it is easier to recognise what row we are in.
- And when LinkToAnotherRecord is created between two tables - it is the primary value that appears in LinkToAnotheRecord column. 

#### Example : ```Primary value```highlighted in actor table

## How is ```Primary value``` identfied for existing database tables ?
- It is usually the first column after the primary key which is not a number. 
- If there is no column which is not a number then the column adjacent to primary key is chosen. 

## Can I change the ```Primary Value``` to another column within tables ?
- Yes, you can. Hover over column which you want as primary column and click ```Set as Primary Value```
