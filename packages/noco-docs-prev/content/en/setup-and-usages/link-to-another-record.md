### Relationship types:

- One to one
  - A Table record in first table is related to only one record of second table.
  - Example: Country has a capital city
- One to many
  - A Table record in first table is related to more than one record of second table. But second table record maps to only one entry of first table
  - NocoDB refers to this category of relationship as **has many**
  - For every **has many** relation defined, NocoDB augments **belongs to** relationship column in the other table automatically
  - Example: Country **has many** Cities. (other way mapping > City **belongs to** Country )
- Many to many
  - A Table record in first table is related to more than one record of second table; second table record can also map to more than on record of first table.
  - NocoDB refers to this category of relationship as **many to many**
  - For every **many to many** relation defined between tables, NocoDB augments **many to many** relationship column in the other table automatically
  - Example: Film **has many** Actors. Actor **has many** Films (works on many films)
