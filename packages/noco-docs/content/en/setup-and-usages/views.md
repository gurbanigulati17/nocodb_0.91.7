## What's a View?

In a table, you can use different views to display your data. You can show specific fields in a View. You can also apply Sorting or Filtering to the View. Each View is independent, which means the configuration applying to View 1 will not apply to View 2. 

To navigate different views, we can select the target one in the view sidebar. By default, Grid View will be created for you after creating the table.You can create multiple views with the same type as you wish, as long as they have unique View names.
